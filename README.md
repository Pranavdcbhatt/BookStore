# BookStore
School Project
This was my school project for 10th grade. 
It is a virtual Book Store written in the Java language on BlueJ IDE. 
This virtual Book Store gives you as a customer, options of various categories of books from Horror to Spiritual and lets you select the book of your choice from the available books. 
It lets you buy any book of the required quantity and presents the bill at the end, by applying taxes on the book price (GST - Goods and Services Tax) which is varying depening on the selected book. 
It also gives an additional option of buying books for a Science or a Commerce course for academic books.
Hope you have fun exploring my project!!
